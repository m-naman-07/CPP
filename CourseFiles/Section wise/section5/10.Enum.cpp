/*
Enumerated
• To make the work faster codes are given to the words it is a
common practise among us as well
• They method of defining enum is
Ex :
enum days { mon , tue , wed , thurs , fri , sat , sun };
            
            0     1     2      3      4     5     6

• Here you can access the values that are assigned to it already
you cannot define your own values here
Ex:
•   By default the index value assigned is 0 but you can change it if you
    want
    enum dept { CS=2, IT , EEE=9, CIVIL };
                 2    3     9       10
•   This feature and its usage is completely upto the programmer
•	Improves readability by replacing magic numbers with meaningful names.
•	Enforced by compiler — catches typos and invalid assignments.
•	Uses less memory and is faster than using strings.
•	Works with switch-case statements.
•	Can restrict variables to only valid enum values.
