🔷 Stack vs Heap Allocation in C++
✅ Stack Allocation:
        int arr[5]; // fixed size, compile-time
 - The size must be known at compile-time (except in compilers that support VLAs, which are non-standard in C++).
 - Memory is managed automatically.
 - You cannot resize it later.
 - Fast access, but limited in size.

✅ Heap Allocation:
        int* arr = new int[n]; // size can be decided at run-time
 - The size is decided at run-time.
 - You can deallocate and reallocate to simulate resizing:
        delete[] arr;
        arr = new int[new_size];
 - This gives the flexibility to "change size", though it's technically creating a new array and copying values.

🧠 Why Can't Stack Arrays Change Size?
Because stack memory is static and contiguous, and:
 - The compiler reserves a fixed amount of memory at compile-time.
 - You can't shift or extend that reserved memory block during runtime.
 - It ensures fast access but no flexibility.

🧠 Why Can Heap Arrays Be Resized?
Because:
 - The heap is a large pool of memory managed at runtime.
 - You can allocate, deallocate, and reallocate memory dynamically using new and delete.
 - But resizing still means creating a new block and copying data if needed.

✅ Summary:
Feature	            Stack Array	        Heap Array
Size Known At	    Compile-time	    Run-time
Resizable	        ❌ No	            ✅ Yes (via reallocation)
Memory Lifetime	    Automatic	        Manual (needs delete[])
Performance	        Fast	            Slower than stack
